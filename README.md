Andor Journals
==============
Documentation and source code of journals for streamlining control of Andor
hardware: FRAPPA, Mosaic, Micropoint, Laser Combiner

Journals, being XML based, are not human-readable outside of Metamorph.  To
work around this the `doc_jnl.py` generates Python-like source code from the
XML for each directory's README

Installation
------------
1.  Install the [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) desktop
    application

2.  Click "Clone in Windows" at the top-left of this page.

3.  In the application, right-click on the newly downloaded repository > view
    in explorer

4.  Copy folders as needed to Metamorph's journals directory, usually:
```
C:\MM\app\mmproc\journals\
```

5.  Follow the folders' README instructions.  Due to the Markdown format it is
    better viewed either here, online, or navigating to the folder in the GitHub
    desktop application
