Quick Journals
==============
Read online documentation and working Journal code.  The design decision process
is explained for building more complex journal macros or improving these sets.

Journals, being XML based, are not human-readable outside of Metamorph.  The
parser `doc_jnl.py` generates Python-like source code from the XML for each
directory's README.
